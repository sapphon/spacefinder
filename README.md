# *Spacefinder* (Unreleased)

## What's this?
#### Short answer: it's an open-source TTRPG aid for [*Starfinder*](https://paizo.com/starfinder/) starship combat written using [Unity3D](https://unity.com/).

#### Long answer: 
If you're here, you already know 
* what *Starfinder* is, 
* that its 'space' combat is modeled on a WW2 naval battle, with ponderous and armored capital ships firing huge cannons directly at each other while smaller, faster, more agile craft dogfight nearby, 
* that that can be a lot to keep track of, and 
* that we used to just use miniatures for this and be happy.

Then the pande came, and TTRPGs went remote.

Things would still have been OK because of the availability of excellent tools for this task already, except that people got grabby and none of them are free.  Anything you might try to use to help you with this will at best charge you money, and at worst try to lock you into some Jabroni's 'platform' of predatory products.

[Paizo](https://paizo.com/)'s permissive game licensing means they don't necessarily get paid when a *Starfinder* tool is distributed the way Disney does when any and all things *Star Wars* are.  That means there's no technical or legal reason such a tool can't be [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement).  

**So**: this aid isn't meant to be the best Starfinder starship combat tracker out there, but it will always be tied for the freest!
